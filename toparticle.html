    <p class="article-paragraph">Working from home is big news. During the COVID-19 pandemic, those lucky enough to have
      avoided layoff are more likely than ever to be adapting to a working environment that is familiar and alien at the
      same time.

      It can be surprisingly tough. A partner on endless noisy team calls, a child who needs guidance on their
      homeschooling assignments, the loss of structure and continuity: they can all be disorienting and exhausting.

      And yet, not having to go to the office can offer surprising opportunities to develop a better work-life balance,
      and to tailor your own working day.

      In this article, we explore the possibilities offered by home working, and navigate a path through the pitfalls.

      <span class="small-heading"> Benefits and Challenges of Working From Home</span>
      Many people are working from home for the first time because of COVID-19. Others are more seasoned remote workers.
      Whatever your circumstances, working from home is likely playing a larger part in your life, or that of people you
      live with, than it ever has before.

      At its best, working from home benefits everyone: you, your family or household, and your organization. Remain
      connected and positive, and you can work productively while maintaining a fulfilling home life – all without the
      stress of a daily commute.

      As Sarah Harvey says in her book "The Ultimate A-Z of Home Working," "Organizations that don't offer home working
      may be missing out on a large pool of talent, many of whom now value home working more than they value a bonus."

      However, there are challenges. Managers may be concerned whether home workers are in fact working. Meanwhile, many
      remote employees can feel isolated. They withdraw from the team dynamic, and suffer from stress and anxiety.
      That's why it is vital to maintain contact with your co-workers, and to cultivate a sense of belonging.

      <span class="small-heading">Working Safely at Home</span>
      At home, you're responsible for creating your own working environment, often in a space quite unlike an office.
      You also need to make sure that you stay mentally and physically healthy.

      <span class="small-heading">Designing Your Work Space</span>
      Creating an effective work space is essential if you want to stay on track and get things done. Have all the
      equipment you need to hand, and ensure that you've got enough room to work comfortably.

      Make it a place where you'll enjoy spending time. However, you also need to be clear – to yourself and to your
      household – that, at certain hours of the day, it's a place of work. A few "office" touches might encourage you to
      be more productive, but you can still personalize your workspace, with fun posters or family photos.

      A high-quality office chair is one of the best investments you can make. But if it's not one that you have the
      space or funds for, be sure that you can sit comfortably. If not, you'll likely find plenty of excuses to get up
      and go somewhere else!

      If you share your home, be assertive and shut out people and pets as far as you can when you're working. At the
      very least, arrange your work area so that distractions aren't in your line of view – including your partner, if
      they're also working from home!

      Pick your spot with light, air and noise in mind, too. Have enough light to see your keyboard clearly, but avoid
      reflected screen glare. Open a window if you can for fresh air. However, if your neighborhood is noisy, consider
      using headphones, while accessing online noise-canceling sites, such as mynoise.net.

      <span class="small-heading">Keeping to Healthy Routines</span>
      Working from home can present new challenges to your physical and mental wellbeing. So establish good routines to
      ensure that you don't lapse into unhealthy behavior.

      Without the time spent commuting, it may be tempting to start earlier and finish later. This can make you more
      tired than usual, so make sure that you keep to regular times for starting and ending work.

      Always ensure that you get enough sleep, and that you eat at regular times. Snacking can leave you feeling hungry
      at the wrong times, and irritable as a result. It's also not a healthy way to eat.

      Regular short breaks can keep you energized and focused, and will also rest your eyes from continuous screen time.
      Try setting a countdown timer while you do, say, an hour of work. When the alarm goes off, reward yourself with a
      five- or 10-minute break to make a coffee, or get some fresh air. Remember, the idea is to take a screen break, so
      no swapping one screen for another by immediately picking up your phone!

      While you need to be comfortable to concentrate and to avoid backache, it's also vital that you get out of your
      chair during the day. See our article, Improving Physical Health and Wellbeing at Work for tips on building
      activity into your routine.

      <span class="small-heading">Working Securely at Home</span>
      You're likely accessing your organization's data and systems remotely, so be secure. Take all the protective
      measures you would when working in the office, and more.

      Use only secure WiFi networks that require a password for access. Maintain strong password protocols and ensure
      that you're using a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Your organization will likely insist on this anyway, but if
      not, ask them about it. It greatly improves cybersecurity.

      When you back up your data, don't save sensitive material to removable media, such as USB sticks or flash drives.
      These can transfer malware and viruses, and you can also lose them easily.

      Lock your computer when it's unattended, even if you're only going to be away from it for a few minutes. Your
      partner and family likely aren't security risks, but they shouldn't be allowed to see confidential data, while
      random keystrokes by your children or pets can cause havoc!

      Keep your devices in a safe place, out of sight of anyone who might be passing your window or work space. This is
      particularly important if your home can be accessed by anyone you don't know well.

      <span class="small-heading">Being Productive While Working From Home</span>
      People working from home sometimes struggle with productivity. Working away from your co-workers, with only remote
      online meetings, risks emotional disconnection and apathy. It can also encourage procrastination .

      So, build in cues to aid your transition into and out of work mode. These can include clear-cut start and finish
      times, and time put aside for exercise and meals. They can also be routines that you associate with getting
      started or winding down, such as listening to your favorite podcast, taking a shower, or calling your mom.

      You might find that it helps to have particular clothes for working at home. Dressing for work can set the right
      mental tone for the day – and avoid the awkwardness of being dialed in to a virtual meeting while you're still in
      your pajamas!

      Also, avoid going into certain areas of your home, or sitting in certain chairs, for example, so that you know
      when you're in "work mode," and when you're not.

      <br>Note:<br>
      You might feel that you need to prove your worth to a remote team and manager by working long hours without
      breaks. This is not healthy. Setting up boundaries and cues will enable you to work far more effectively and to
      avoid burnout.

      <span class="small-heading">Staying Focused at Home</span>
      A 2008 University of California report found that it took an average of 23 minutes 15 seconds to get back on task
      following an interruption. And it can be tough to stay focused when working from home, so use techniques to
      minimize distraction .

      If you get caught up doing household chores, or suffer frequent interruptions from family or friends, reset your
      boundaries, and ask for help in maintaining them.

      Control your social media use. Think carefully about which notifications to keep on, and which to mute until
      later. Allocate time slots for checking your phone, and put it to one side outside those times.

      If your organization has busy internal communications channels, discipline yourself to check them at set times. If
      you don't, you'll find yourself being pulled away from your important tasks to waste energy on seemingly urgent
      but less critical activities.
